# Electrochemical-Wavelet-Denoising
This Python project showcases advanced signal processing for electrochemical time-series data, a critical challenge in modern sensor development. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) via Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) is used to achieve superior noise reduction from simulated Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV) data.
